## What is a Keylogger?
Key logging, often referred to as keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that a person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.

## How to install and run the program? 
1. Go to `main.py`
2. You can copy the code in there.
3. paste to an Python IDE or use an online compiler and run the code.
